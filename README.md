[![UDM-Pro-SE Podman](https://github.com/unifi-utilities/unifios-utilities/actions/workflows/podman-udmp-udmse.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/unifi-utilities/unifios-utilities/actions/workflows/podman-udmp-udmse.yml)

## Branches
1. [1.12.x](https://github.com/unifi-utilities/unifios-utilities/tree/v1.12.x) - Support for 1.x.x firmware line
1. [main](https://github.com/unifi-utilities/unifios-utilities) - Support for 2.4.x and above

### Current Branch is main, supporting UniFi OS 2.5.x

A collection of things to enhance the capabilities of your Unifi Dream Machine, Dream Machine Pro or UXG-Pro.

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes for UniFi OS 3.x

UniFi OS 3.x no longer supports podman. The utilities in this respository **may not work as documented**. For alternatives, review the documentation in [nspawn-container](https://github.com/unifi-utilities/unifios-utilities/tree/main/nspawn-container) or consider direct installations like [wpa_supplicant-UniFi-OS-3.x for AT&T Fiber](https://github.com/jphamdev/wpa_supplicant-UniFi-OS-3.x).

## Custom Kernel

If you want to do a custom kernel with wireguard support, multicast, multipath routing that is now a possiblity.
Please see the repo and please use at your own risk. This a much larger change than anything in this repo.

## Custom Podman Builds for UDM-SE

All artifacts can be found on IPFS

[IPFS Gateway](https://unifi.boostchicken.io) ![Cloudflare](https://img.shields.io/badge/Cloudflare-F38020?style=for-the-badge&logo=Cloudflare&logoColor=white)

Extract the zip to the root of your device!
Look at the assets on the Podman workflow.

### UDM Base
Standard Image for base UDM, systemd removed

### UDM Pro / SE
Base build with apparmor, systemd, devicemapper removal, and overlay kept

Works on PRO on 2.x, for 1.x use the UDM Base still. 

*Does not work on 3.x use nspawn-container*

## macvlan kernel module for UDR

Ui have stopped building the `macvlan` kernel module into the kernel for the UDR, which means containers cannot
have their own routable IPs out of the box. This module is being built and distributed separately, and can be found
at [macvlan-unifi-udr](https://github.com/whi-tw/macvlan-unifi-udr).

## General Tools

### on-boot-script-2.x

Do this first. Enables `init.d` style scripts to run on every boot of your UDM.
Includes examples to run `wpa-supplicant/eap-proxy` and/or `ntop-ng` on startup.
Follow this [readme](https://github.com/unifi-utilities/unifios-utilities/blob/main/on-boot-script-2.x/README.md).

**It enables complete customization of your UDM/P and fills the gap that config.gateway.json left behind.**

### nspawn-container
Enables containers on UniFiOS 3.x,  this replaces podman.

### podman-update

Updates Podman, conmon, and runc to a recent version.This allows docker-compose usage as well.

Works on PRO on 2.x, for 1.x use the UDM Base still. 

**Does not working on 3.x use nspawn-container**

### container-common

Apply this after on-boot-script.
Updates container defaults to maintain **stable disk usage footprint** of custom containers.
**Prevents logs filling up UDM storage full**.

### python

If you need python3 on your UDM, generally not recommended, can always use it in unifi-os container.

## DNS Providers

Install a DNS server that functions as a network-wide ad and tracker blocker, and which can also securely proxy encrypted DNS requests to an upstream DNS provider.
Begin by following the instructions to setup [on-boot-script](https://github.com/unifi-utilities/unifios-utilities/tree/main/on-boot-script) and [dns-common](https://github.com/unifi-utilities/unifios-utilities/tree/main/dns-common/on_boot.d).
Then, follow the guides below to setup either Pi-Hole, NextDNS, or AdGuard Home.

### dns-common

Base configuration for DNS server containers, both IPv4 and IPv6.
Utilizes MacVLAN CNI plugins to completely isolate the network stack.

## Unsupported / No longer maintained


| Name 	| URL 	| Description 	|
|------	|-----	|-------------	|
|suricata |   	| Updates suricata to a recent version.  Now in firmware    	|
| Jumbo Frames   	| <https://github.com/kalenarndt/udmp-jumbo-frames> 	|   native jumbo frame support for the UDM and UDM-Pro is added in the 1.12.13 EA firmware, support for the UDM-SE is not yet announced.   	|

## Reimaging your UDM

Working in the shell means that mistakes can happen. Deleted directories or packages may break the underlying software that makes your UDM-Pro SE function as designed. Thankfully, Unifi Support seems to have provided the following process to help bring your UDM back to the stock image.

1. Remove the unit from your network and disconnect the cables from the unit.
2. Press down the reset button for 40+ seconds without power and cables.
3. Release the reset button and power the unit.
4. Again press the reset button for 15+ seconds.

Thanks to user [cfallwell](https://github.com/cfallwell) for describing this fix [here](https://github.com/unifi-utilities/unifios-utilities/issues/428#issuecomment-1386212026).
